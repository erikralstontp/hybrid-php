    Single Page Applications are very popular and commonly used for web sites and experiences that need to appear seamless. One of the main disadvantages with SPAs is that they lack any server infrastructure to create server generated pages. These sites tend to be extremely weak when it comes to SEO.

<p>
    Why sacrifice having a remarkable web application for better SEO? The point of this project is to allow for rapid development of an SPA using backbone.js that allows for server-side rendering for enhanced searchability.

    With new API driven CMS like prismic.io, a framework such as hybrid-php is an ideal front-end solution. In fact, hybrid-php can be plugged into any json driven data source.

<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>Hybrid-PHP operates on a standard lamp server running php 5.5. It could probably run on 5.3 too but I never tested it.</p>
